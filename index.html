    <p>Until recently, I was like you. I grew up in seedy Diamond Bar, California with one brother and two loving parents. My dad was a meager Venture Capitalist, with only 10,000,000,000 dimes to his name, but he worked hard and was a good man. At times two or more of us were starving for aquatic excitement and had to share the pool, but we made do with the indoor movie theatre. I went to Diamond Bar High School. I listened to Cabi Cabi and Ting Ma Ma de Hua by Jay Chou twenty thousand times over four years. I tried out for the tennis team with a pink dress shirt and sunglasses. They said Oooh cool shirt man where'd you get it, you're so great at tennis can you play Singles 1? I said Banana Republic b**** obviously. My mom bought it for me and no I don't want to play for your team anymore. I rejected them. They didn't know anything. Stupid D***F***'s</p>

    <p>After high school I attended UC Irvine to study Environmental Engineering and I drove a prius named Baby Crew, after J Crew. Oh maybe that's where I got the dress shirt from. They're both bad anyways I've learned. Don't buy them. Go to Theory if you want a good value brand. I'm at UCI, I'm at UCI. I said that to myself so often that it culminated in a tremendously done but tragic music video. They were Zot Zot but I was Not Not. And so I transferred to NYU Stern and went from an Anteater to a bright and shiny tool. Much cleaner, my mom told me.</p>

    <p>Excerpt from Jordan Bio: "Somewhere there is a little kid working to enhance what we've done. It may take awhile, but someone will come along who approaches the game the way I did. He won't skip steps. He won't be afraid. He will learn from my example, just as I learned from others. He will master the fundamentals. Maybe he will take off from the free-throw line and do a 360 in midair. Why not? No one thought they would see a 6-foot-9 point guard or a 7-foot-7 center. But here we are. There are now more 6-foot-10 perimeter players than at any time in history. Magic would have been a center 30 years ago. Evolution knows no bounds. Unless they change the height of the basket or otherwise alter the dimensions of the game, there will be a player much greater than me." <br>-Michael Jordan<br>-Howard Liu</p>
